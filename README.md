### about me
I'm Jannick from Elsterwerda, Germany.
I'm visiting 12th Grade on the Elsterschloss-Gymnasium Elsterwerda (Secondary School).
My Interests are Hardware/Software and - as you can see in the Photo on my tee - Firefighters. in Brandenburg(my State) it's allowed to be a fireman at 16 years.
In school(secondary level 2, grade 11 and 12) I chose intensified course in IT and English because I am somehow good at it and like to do them.
In first year of school IT(grade 10) we started learning: programming (especially C++), logic, networks, and at the end we created databases.
Now, I'm in my second year of Computer-Science at school and we are learning Algorithms & Programs rn.
In my third year of CS in school, we just started with Automata/Turing machine
additionally, we have a Seminar course about Economy, where we have to create a project about any topic we wish. ~~We chose to create a [Rent-management platform](https://mietkontor-immobilienverwaltung.tech).There the renters have every tool you need to manage your rents~~
I think the Economy-course is very good, because you are learning skills, you would usually never learn during the normal lessons.
...now back to the programming...
